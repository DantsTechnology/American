This information may contain personal information and statistical information. We may collect device-specific information (such as hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network Information, including your mobile phone number).

            <p>A cookie is a tiny element of data that our Websites can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize your computer when you return. Cookies also assist with performance of various aspects of the Website. You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from our Website, you may limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our Website.

            <p>A web beacon (also known as a âtracking pixelâ or âclear GIFâ) is a clear graphic image (typically a one-pixel tag) that is delivered through a web browser or HTML e-mail, typically in conjunction with a cookie.

            <p>If we are unable to associate the information collected from you or your devices to you, as some may be purely statistical or technical without any identifier or connection to you, such is not considered personal information for purposes of this Privacy Policy. For example, you may use a computer to navigate to the Website, and the Website may record an entry to the Website by a personal computer running Windows 10. This information has no direct link to you and cannot be associated with you and is therefore not considered Personal Information.</p>
      
            <h3 class="uso">2. How We Use It</h3>

            <ul>If required or permitted to do so by law or if, in good faith, Company believes that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend Companyâs rights and property or prevent fraud; (3) protect Company against abuse, misuse or unauthorized use Companyâs products or services; (4) protect the personal safety or property of its personnel, users of the Website or the public, and/or (5) comply with tax reporting requirements.

            <ul>If the information is non-personal information (from which individuals cannot be identified, and which do not relate to individuals) in aggregate form, and the disclosure is for business purposes, such as consultants and advisors to Company.</ul>
            <ul>If Company, in good faith, determines that you have used the service to menace, threaten, harass, intimidate or otherwise deceptively pose as another person, or in any other way in violation of law. Simply, if you attempt to use the Website for any unlawful means, you have no expectation of privacy.</ul>
            <u>If a third party  acquires all or substantially all of the assets of, or ownership interest in, Company whether by merger, acquisition, reorganization or otherwise, Company may transfer its database, including Personal Information contained therein, to the third party.</u>

            <p>We may also collect, use and disclose personal information you provide in order to contact you; respond to your inquiries and provide you with relevant information from time to time; provide services and products requested by you; administer or otherwise carry out our obligations in relation to any agreement you have with us; compile statistics for analytical and marketing purposes; and, any other purposes about which we inform you when we ask you for information.</p>

            <h3 class="proteccion">3. How We Protect It</h3>

In doing so, Company uses appropriate physical, organizational and technological measures to protect the personal information you provide to us against loss or theft, and unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. This includes limiting access on a âneed-to-knowâ basis. However, no electronic data transmission can be guaranteed to be secure from access by unintended recipients and Company will not be responsible for any breach of security unless this breach is due to its own gross negligence. Although we are committed to employing reasonable technology in order to protect the security of our Website, even with the best technology, no website is 100% secure.

Company encourages users to be aware when you leave this Website and to read the privacy statements of each website you visit that collects personal information.
